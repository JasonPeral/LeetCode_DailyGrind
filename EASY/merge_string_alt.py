LeetCode 1768: Merge Strings Alternately

Given two strings, merge them by alternating characters starting with word1.
If one string is longer, append the rest at the end.

Examples:
Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"     → Output: "apbqcr"
Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"     → Output: "apbqrs"
